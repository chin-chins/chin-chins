## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub!! There isn't a lot here for now, but I hope to fill it with a lot of my projects in the future!! I'm currently hoping to study more C and C++, 
and deepen my understanding of Python. I'm really into Web Dev and Web Design at the moment, and I'm currently working on my own website! It's proving to be a lot of fun 
(and a bit difficult ;-;) but as learning it's ok 🙂‍↕️

This project is a personal project/assignment for the GWC Pathways program. I made a website that talks about food security and gives some facts about the issue. 
It also has a resources page that lists different organizations that users can use to donate to causes :) 

This is also my first repository on GitHub!! Hopefully, this project can be a stepping stone for me to build even better websites in the future :)
